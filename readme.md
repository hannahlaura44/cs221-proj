## Key Components of the MDP:
1. **States (S)**: The states represent the different conditions of the system.
  - State of Charge (SOC) of the EV battery.
  - Price for discharging electricity back to the grid.
  - Cost of purchasing electricity from the grid.
  - Ride demand (which could be a value indicating the likelihood or number of ride requests).
2. **Actions (A)**: The decisions the EV owner can make.
  - Charge the EV.
  - Discharge the EV to the grid.
  - Provide a ride.
3. **Rewards (R)**: The immediate payoffs received after taking an action.
  - Money made from discharging to the grid.
  - Money spent on charging the EV.
  - Money earned from providing rides.
  - Penalties for actions like overcharging or depleting the battery excessively.
4. **Transitions (T)**: These describe how the state changes as a result of the actions taken.
  - The SOC changes based on charging, discharging, or providing a ride.
  - Time progresses, influencing electricity prices and ride demand.
  - Electricity prices and ride demand change based on external factors.

## Step-by-Step Implementation:
1. Define the State Space: The SOC, electricity prices, and ride demand.
2. Define the Action Space: Charging, discharging, and providing a ride.
3. Define the Reward Function: Based on electricity prices, ride demand, and SOC.
4. Implement the Environment: Create a simulation environment that models the EV charging/discharging/ride-providing scenario.
5. Implement the RL Algorithm: Use an RL algorithm like DQN to learn the optimal policy.
